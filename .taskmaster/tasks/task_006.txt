# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Personal Voice Model Synthesis
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Enable synthesis of user voice models with imported songs.
# Details:
Implement the POST /model/infer endpoint to apply user voice models to imported songs. Ensure seamless integration with the vocal separation feature.

# Test Strategy:
Test voice synthesis with different songs and user models, ensuring quality and synchronization.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Synthesis Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a detailed design for the synthesis endpoint, including input/output specifications and error handling.

The design should outline how the endpoint will receive requests, process data, and return results. Consider edge cases and potential errors.

## 2. Integrate Vocal Separation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Integrate vocal separation functionality into the synthesis endpoint.
### Details:
Use existing vocal separation algorithms to process input audio and separate vocals from background music.

## 3. Test with Different Models [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Conduct tests using various voice models to ensure compatibility and performance.
### Details:
Select a range of voice models and test their integration with the synthesis endpoint. Document performance metrics and any issues encountered.

## 4. Ensure Quality Assurance [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Implement quality assurance measures to ensure the synthesis endpoint meets performance and accuracy standards.
### Details:
Develop a set of quality metrics and conduct thorough testing to ensure the endpoint produces high-quality outputs.

## 5. Complexity Analysis and Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Analyze the complexity of the integration and optimize for performance.
### Details:
Review the entire integration process, identify bottlenecks, and implement optimizations to improve efficiency and reduce processing time.
