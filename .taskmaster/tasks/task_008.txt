# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement LLM-Based Feedback Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Provide natural language feedback on user performance using an LLM.
# Details:
Set up a server to interface with GPT-3.5 or a local LLM. Implement the POST /feedback/generate endpoint to process singing data and return feedback.

# Test Strategy:
Validate feedback generation with sample data, ensuring relevance and clarity.

### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop an API endpoint to receive and process feedback from users.
### Details:
Create a RESTful API endpoint that allows users to submit feedback. Ensure the endpoint is secure and can handle concurrent requests.

## 3. Process singing data [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Develop a module to process and analyze singing data for feedback.
### Details:
This involves creating algorithms to analyze singing data, extract relevant features, and prepare it for feedback generation.

## 4. Test feedback relevance [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Evaluate the relevance and quality of feedback provided by the system.
### Details:
Conduct tests to ensure that the feedback generated is relevant and useful to the users. This may involve user testing and iterative improvements.
