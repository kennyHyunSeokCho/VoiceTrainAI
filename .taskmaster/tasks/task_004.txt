# Task ID: 4
# Title: Setup RVC V2 Model Training
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the backend service for training RVC V2 models using user recordings.
# Details:
Set up a GPU-enabled server with PyTorch to train RVC V2 models. Implement the POST /model/train endpoint to handle training requests. Ensure asynchronous processing and user notifications upon completion.

# Test Strategy:
Validate model training with sample data, ensuring model accuracy and notification delivery.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up GPU-enabled server [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Provision and configure a server with GPU capabilities to support model training and inference.
### Details:
Select a cloud provider, choose an appropriate instance type with GPU support, and install necessary drivers and libraries.

## 2. Implement training endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop an API endpoint to handle model training requests.
### Details:
Create a RESTful API endpoint that accepts training data and parameters, and initiates the training process on the server.

## 3. Handle asynchronous processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Implement asynchronous processing for model training to avoid blocking operations.
### Details:
Use a task queue or similar mechanism to manage training jobs, allowing the server to handle multiple requests efficiently.

## 4. Implement user notifications [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Develop a system to notify users about the status of their training jobs.
### Details:
Set up email or in-app notifications to inform users when their training jobs start, progress, and complete.

## 5. Test model accuracy [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Evaluate the accuracy of the trained model using a test dataset.
### Details:
Run the trained model on a separate test dataset to measure its performance and accuracy.

## 6. Complexity analysis and optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.3
### Description: Analyze the complexity of the server setup and processing, and optimize for performance.
### Details:
Review the server configuration and processing logic to identify bottlenecks and optimize resource usage.
