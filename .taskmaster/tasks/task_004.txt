# Task ID: 4
# Title: Setup RVC V2 Model Training
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the backend service for training RVC V2 models using user recordings.
# Details:
Set up a GPU-enabled server with PyTorch to train RVC V2 models. Implement the POST /model/train endpoint to handle training requests. Ensure asynchronous processing and user notifications upon completion.

# Test Strategy:
Validate model training with sample data, ensuring model accuracy and notification delivery.
